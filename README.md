# Splunk
This is a small collection of various pre built dashboards as well as some useful searches for Splunk.
Over time, more will be added not for any specific intention, other than to give you a helping hand or 
a step in your Splunk journey.

Dashboards - Create a new dashboard, click edit in the top right corner, click source in the top left corner.
Now replace the xml on that screen with the xml in the dash files on this repo.
